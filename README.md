# Project Domain:
A location-mapping & way-finding service application based around the UofT St. George campus, designed primarily for students.

# Software Specification:
This application will allow the User to input their origin location and the destination location, and the map will provide the shortest route(s). The map area is the UofT campus, with outer boundaries at Bloor St. West, Bay St., Spadina Ave., and College St. The User can find destinations via a search engine that returns locations on the map related to their query. The User can find and choose a specific destination they have in mind, or they can choose from a list of categories of places (e.g. cafes, libraries, etc.) and receive suggestions of possible destinations in the chosen category. They can also receive general destination suggestions that don’t require search input, which are the most popular destinations on campus. The User can see their location search history and are able to re-use past searches, or delete them, either all at once or one-by-one. The User can also vote “YES” or “NO” to the routes suggested to them to indicate if they did or didn’t like them. The approval rate of a route (as provided by other users) is shown to the User when the route is given.


FOR PHASE 1:
We only worked on 4 use cases: 

1) PINPOINT: John wants to go to Gerstein Library, so he inputs “gerstein library” into the search engine; the map only shows him the on-campus location as a destination.

2) TEXT-BASED QUERY: John wants to find any library, so he inputs keyword/phrase “library”/“libra”; the search tab returns a list/sublist of library destinations, shows each location on the map, and allows him to select one as a destination. 

3) MOST-POPULAR/DEFAULT: John wants to find the most population locations on-campus, so he can search without inputting a prompt, and the app will return the most searched/visited locations. 

4) APP-SUGGESTED: John goes to the search engine and chooses “cafe” from a list of suggestions provided by the app. The app then returns a list of cafes on-campus.



** we didnt have enough time to merge = so each use case is in a separate Branch ,
